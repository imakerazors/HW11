# HW11

This repo contains the information necessary to configure a google cloud container engine with Kurbenets and then stand up a MongoDb contianer with persistant storage. The steps to complete this task are in the dickerson_hw11.pdf file. I've also included the HW 10 submission, which would need to be completed before the HW11 submission could be followed
